📂 The Plan: Building the Framework

pages/: Where we store the "logic" of the website (selectors and actions).

tests/: Where we store the actual "test scenarios."



To run only Sanity tests: npx playwright test --grep @sanity

To run everything EXCEPT Sanity: npx playwright test --grep-invert @sanity


Component	        Status	        Purpose
BasePage	         ✅	           Handles the browser instance and core navigation.
LoginPage	         ✅	           Contains all selectors and login logic (POM).
InventoryPage	     ✅	           Manages the product dashboard elements.
Playwright Config	 ✅	           Manages baseURL and .env loading.
GitHub CI/CD	     ✅	           Runs tests automatically using GitHub Secrets.

Key Technical Skills Acquired

. Type-Safe Automation: Built a robust suite using TypeScript for better refactoring and error catching.

. Scalable Architecture: Implemented Page Object Model (POM) to ensure low-maintenance test code.

. Infrastructure as Code: Developed a GitHub Actions YAML pipeline for continuous integration.

. Cross-Browser Testing: Orchestrated simultaneous execution on Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit.

. Test Suite Optimization: Utilized Parallelism and Tagging (@sanity / @regression) to manage execution speed and scope.

. Security Best Practices: Secured credentials using Environment Variables and GitHub Secrets.

. Data Strategy: Engineered a Dynamic Data Generator to eliminate test data collisions.

. Observability: Integrated HTML Reporting and Trace Viewing for cloud-based debugging.
